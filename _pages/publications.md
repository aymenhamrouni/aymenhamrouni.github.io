<meta name="description" content="Aymen Hamrouni (Student Member, IEEE) received the Diplome d’Ingenieur degree (summa cum laude) in telecommunication engineering from the Ecole Superieure des Communications de Tunis (SUP’COM), Tunis, Tunisia, in 2019 and the Masters in Electrical and Computer Engineering (Hons.) from the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) where he is currently pursuing his Ph.D. degree. From 2019 to 2021, Aymen was affiliated as a Research Scholar with the School of Systems and Enterprises, Stevens Institute of Technology, Hoboken, NJ, USA.  Aymen is a young, passionate, and self-motivated
AI researcher with a versatile background in Information Technologies and equipped with thorough mathematical Optimization knowledge, Graph Theory expertise, and advanced Data Science skills. Fluent in Python, C/C++, and Matlab, Aymen’s interests lay in the intersection of graph neural networks, deep
generative modelings, applied machine learning and optimization, mathematical modeling, graph theory,
and the Internet-of-Things. Aymen is currently serving as an active reviewer in the IEEE IoT Journal, IEEE
TCSS, IEEE Access, IEEE Communication Letters, etc." />
