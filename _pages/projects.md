* A Video-based Visual Transformer for Crowd Management Monitoring

* Multi-modal Asymmetric Autoencoders for Massive Photo Collection Applications
**Generative Adversarial Networks for de-noising Real-time Video feed Corrupted with Environmental Effects for Autonoums Navigation systems.

    Created a low-latency video processing pipeline where videos captured by a low-quality camera equipped to the navigation systems of a device (e.g., UAV, autonomous vehicle) is cleaned from rain droplets and rainstreaks and other environmental effects and then reconstructed and enhanced. The resultant de-noised feed becomes more plausible and artifact-free to the driver and also to object detection/recognition algorithms.
* Resource Allocation in Social IoT using Graph Neural Networks
