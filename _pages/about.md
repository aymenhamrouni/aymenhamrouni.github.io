<h1 id="bio-graphy">Biography</h1>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
I am a highly motivated researcher with the eager to always learn more and build a successful career. I am passionate about algorithm design, applied deep learning and artificial intelligence for visual computing. I am keen to make a real impact in the world. I am an autonomous and self-motivated person. In fact, I often take the lead and start projects on my own because I enjoy it. Compared to most people my age, I have more self-discipline and more willingness to try and learn new things, something I think it is proven by my projects and research record so far. I have received my CPGE diploma of Mathematics/Physics (with honors) in 2016 from <a href="https://ipeis.rnu.tn/">l'Institut Préparatoire aux Etudes d'Ingénieur de Sfax</a>. After that, I received the Diplome d’Ingenieur degree (summa cum laude) in telecommunication engineering from the <a href="http://www.supcom.mincom.tn/">Ecole Superieure des Communications de Tunis (SUP’COM)</a>, Tunis, Tunisia, in 2019. I am currently a M.Sc. Graduate student affiliated with the <a href="https://itl.kaust.edu.sa/">Innovative Technologies Laboratories (ITL)</a> under the supervision of <a href="https://yehiamassoud.com/">Prof. Yehia Massoud</a> at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Abdullah_University_of_Science_and_Technology">King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST)</a>. During the period form 2019 to 2021, I worked as a Junior research scientist with the School of Systems and Enterprises at <a href="https://www.stevens.edu/">Stevens Institute of Technology</a>, NJ, USA. </div>
